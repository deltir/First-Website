			<h2>Where It All Began...</h2>
				<p>You may find yourself wondering, "Who <em>is</em> this Alci character? At what point did the big bald head become a permanent fixture? What's up with the MS Paint banner? Why are they such a majestic blend of elements - like a pixie reminiscent of Tinkerbell, Eleven from <cite>Stranger Things</cite>, but also a sweet and very poorly disguised alien like from <cite>Strange Planet</cite> all rolled into one?" Well, my friend. You've come to the right unboxing video! ... But there aren't any videos. Or boxes. Just text, and maybe some photographic assistance. I'm camera shy and counting on your imagination here, <i>okay?</i> Remember being a kid and playing with sticks? Well, let's build a stick fort in that beautiful brain of yours. (I bet you probably didn't expect to have homework on your first day with <em>ME</em>, huh? Enjoy your reading assignment, nerd!)</p>

				<p>&#129378 You may also find yourself wondering at this point, "What (in tarnation, if you're from Oklahoma) have I gotten myself into, and how does any of this apply to coding?" To that I would kindly retort, "This is my first website, I'm going to get to that, but I'm also going to have fun along the way because life is short and even <i>shorter</i> when it's stressful, so please be patient. Take a deep breath. You probably have some stale air sitting down in those lungs. Me too. Let's clear that stuff out! It's good for ya! I'll try to make this as painless as possible. See this delightful imagery I've already provided you? I like to emphasize the power of the mind, and to your credit, you've already made it this far with that imagination and patience. You're doing great! So, buckle up and enjoy the ride!"</p>
				<p>&#129378 Let's dive in, shall we? At around 8 years old, I moved with my soon-to-be-a-broke-college-student Mom and 2.5 year old autistic sister into a house my grandparents rented out to us in this tiny little town called Langford, SD. My mom couldn't afford to buy me electronics or even books being the single mother of two children that she was, so I literally read a dictionary for fun the summer before 4th grade. I have always been pretty scrappy though, and I found ways to utilize my resources. I became the people person and lifelong learner I am today during this formative time. My great grandpa had moved in with my grandparents and my Uncle Richie on the opposite side of this town of 270 people (roughly 6 blocks away), and we would go over there almost every day before and after school. My great grandpa was a World War 2 veteran who taught me how to play war (the good, fun kind - don't worry), solitaire, black jack, and gin rummy, and instilled in me a fondness for oldies, Westerns, and witty comebacks. My grandma cooked for all of us often, loved bird watching and showing me the minute differences in species, and taught me how to bake and play Sudoku. She was and is the squishy beating heart of the family, and would come over to help me do chores like dishes while my Mom was busy working. My grandpa was always the handyman, taught me how to paint and how to be pragmatic, and showed me the importance of staying informed about world events. My Uncle Richie was quite the counter culture hippie at the time, and he helped grow my awareness of pathological capitalism, effective humanitarianism, and systems thinking. My Mom, being just as much of a philomath as myself, helped me to understand the importance of self reflection and authenticity through all of these varying inputs. I like to think that that push to look inwards was exactly what helped cement the fierce independence and love for people that I carry with me today. At 8 years old, I realized that I am not just a sum of my parts as a catalog of experiences. I am the system that emphasizes and mutes the parts that show - I am the experience! I owe this intrapersonal intelligence to each and every member of my community during this time and the time that followed.
				<p>&#129378 On <time>January 1st, 2007</time>, I turned 9 years old and began to experience my first existential crisis over how soon being "a decade old" would be. That's already one-eigth of a life lived! Thankfully, my great grandpa (86 years young) bought himself a new computer and gave me a distract- I mean, his old computer. Finally! I could utilize this fascinating world of lightning fast information at my fingertips and stay connected with the revelations of an evolving world that I would one day be a part of! ... Or not. The SoC (I believe) was nonfucntional, so all I got was a bulky MS Paint, Minesweeper, Notepad, and Solitaire machine, which still beat the 5lb dictionary by a long shot! Aside from finetuning my logic and offering me a space to easily develop complex characters and story arcs, I was introduced to the magical world of settings through this machine. I became immediately fascinated by the plethora of options available to me in the settings menu and thoroughly entertained by the specificity with which I could select hues and create patterns in MS Paint. With this being roughly around the same time that my Uncle Richie gave me some of his <cite>Choose Your Own Adventure</cite> and <cite>Animorph</cite> books, I was hell bent on squeezing every drop of empowerment I could from these new tools.</p>
				<p>&#129378 Quite frankly, not much has functionally changed in me since those formative years. I still enjoy intersecting my longing for pragmatic simplicity with eclectic interests. Whether it's a deep dive into James Hoffmann's mad coffee science or just a hot yoga session at the Fit & Fire Studios to declutter my mind and recenter within my body, I've found that life really is all about balance. With these values in place, integrating the healing properties of socioemotional intelligence and my humanitarian desire to alleviate suffering with my inclination to rebuild and create from the ground up comes quite naturally, because to me these fields tend to be holistically on the same spectrum, akin to weeding a garden. What's choking off growth? What is nourishing? What builds symbiotically and what destroys parity? These findings aren't personal. It's just information! And the more information we have, the better equipped we are to tackle the tasks ahead of us effectively. In short, are we listening for the information that is being communicated to us? I love to ask these questions and seek out answers, because to me, life is just a game of decoding. I've always loved communications and the subtle multitudes of variations on language we use to convey important content with one another. Be it math, science, music, art, linguistics, sociology, or coding, I hear wants and needs being communicated and met to the best of their ability by living beings. It's just a matter of decoding the data around us!</p>
				<p>&#129378 Incredibly, I find myself plopped into the position I'm in now and I am discovering how much coding is just another one of life's many languages! I'm thrilled to have the tools that I need at this point to dive deep and learn something I've always been curious about, and in the midst of the online era being still fairly young. It feels like such a badge of honor to be working for the same college that I'm acquiring my degree from to fulfill my lifelong dream, and I feel truly honored. This experience is everything to me.</p>
			<h3>Cutting To the Chase:</h3>
				<p>My brain really enjoys this expansion in knowledge, and by blatantly ignoring brevity, I've created a space to show off my growing understanding of coding languages and processes!</p>
			<h3>Wrapping Things Up:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>YOUnitled. What is that all about? A fun story, actually. Remember that dictionary replacement I got for my 9th birthday? (Didn't think there would be a quiz, now did you?) Well, on that MS paint machine, I used to draw A LOT. Like an I-had-to-git-my-Mom-to-show-me-how-to-create-folders-to-sort-all-the-patterns-and-drawings-I-did A LOT. And yet, somehow, I was utterly convinced that a new, unsaved MS Paint file would be automatically saved as "Unitled" (pronounced "you-KNIT-uld") upon closing the application instead of "Untitled". It's been an inside joke in the family ever since. (I also brazenly asked my mom one year about inviting my great grandpa who fought in <abbr>WW2</abbr> to the Vetrinarian's Day Concert I had coming up in <date>November</date>.)</li>
					<li>Memi Selfanei... What? This is my way of saying Me, Myself, and I, and is how I have myself saved in my phone should I need to send texts right back at me. I also just like that it looks like it could be someone's actual name.</li>
					<li>The bald head became a permanent fixture after I realized that bangs were overrated and I had a beautiful shiny fivehead to show off. I was also exposed to examples of lovely, successful women who rocked such a haircut during my first adult years (such as Ani Difranco and Sinead O'Connor), and after feeling my first summer rain, I can't imagine going back.</li>
					<li>I actually did dress up as Eleven one year for Halloween! I got to carry around a box of Eggos all night and everything :)</li>
					<li>The term "tarnation" is actually used all over the country, not just within the border of Oklahoma... by ME. >:D</li>
					<li>Fun Fact!: My Mom, Michelle Kelly, graduated from Northern State University back in <time>May 2015</time> with her BSEd in Spanish. She is currently a teacher up for a Teacher of the Year award down in Idabel, Oklahoma, where her students and fellow teachers alike are quite grateful to have her. As they should be. She's an incredible teacher (just look at her kids) and you guys helped get her there!</li>
